Single Page Portfolio Website
====================

This repository is a replica of my portfolio website. My current portfolio website is based off of Wordpress, and eventually would like to have it hosted without Wordpress. This Single Page website example is something I will be considering when taking my website off of Wordpress, due to its simplicity.

Using Jade and SASS (compiling to HTML and CSS), Gulp, and Javascript, I have created a near duplicate of my website. 

Instructions on running this file
=====================

1. Download, and unzip to desktop
2. Open Terminal (or any program in which you will be able to run a local server)
3. Type cd Desktop (this will bring you to your Desktop)
4. Type cd singlepage-portfolio (this will bring you into the folder)
5. Run npm install (you will be required to type your password, password will not appear by deafult)
6. If you get errors, run sudo npm install
7. Once node is installed, run node server.js
8. Your server should not be running! Navigate to localhost:3000 in any browser

Thank you for checking this out!
